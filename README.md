# 💳 Transaction Fraud Detection System

This project is a **data science and machine learning pipeline** designed to detect fraudulent transactions using supervised learning models.

It explores common preprocessing techniques, builds multiple classifiers (including Random Forest and XGBoost), and evaluates their performance to help identify potentially fraudulent activity.

## 📌 **Project Overview**
The main goals of this project:
- Analyze and preprocess transactional data.
- Build and compare different machine learning models:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Decision Trees
- Apply normalization techniques to improve model performance.
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
